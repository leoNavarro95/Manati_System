# Manati System
**Manati System** is an Automatic Water Level System based on Esp32 MCU

## Features
This **system** is designed to ensure that your water tanks are never empty. The ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the water level in a tank. On the other hand, a flow meter is used to detect that the water pump is working correctly. The ESP32 microcontroller is used as the brain of the system. This MCU has WIFI connectivity and this makes it possible to implement an [embedded web application](https://github.com/leoNavarro95/Esp32-Web-Tank-System "Esp32-Web-Tank-System").
